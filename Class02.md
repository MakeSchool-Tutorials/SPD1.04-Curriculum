- Write, read and run tests to ensure high durability of code base.

### Challenges
In this exercise weâ€™ll learn how to implement the TDD process by developing a simple command line calculator app from scratch with Node.js.
- [Unit Testing with Mocha](https://www.taniarascia.com/unit-testing-in-javascript/)
    - The application should add, subtract, divide, and multiply any two numbers.
    - The application should display a warning and exit if it receives any input that does not consist of numbers.
    - The system will provide a command line interface that allows the end users to utilize program functionality.

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
