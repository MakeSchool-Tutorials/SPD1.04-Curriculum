## Why should I write a test?

- Testing is something that a lot of engineering teams take very seriously from day one and as result, it's a big part of a work environment and development culture. If you haven't done testing before it's ok, hopefully by the end of this tutorial you will be a wizard when it comes to testing.

- Testing your code will save you and your team a lot of time, and it will make your development experience much easier and work happier by writing unit tests. Happy programmers write better code.

## What is Unit Testing?

- One of the smallest parts of your application is called units, testing these units to check whether is a fit for use or not is called unit testing. 

- If we are going to create a test  for a given function or a component of our code, then we need to make sure that the function or component by itself, separate from everything else, is doing what it is intended to do, no more, not less and mock rest of things which are not under test.
