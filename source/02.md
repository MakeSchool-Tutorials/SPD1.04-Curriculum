### Testing Your Code Tutorials

- There are many great resources to help learn how to develop and utilize tests in your applications. We will use this tutorial for this section of the SPD course. This tutorial series uses [Getting Started With Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#automated-vs-manual-testing) from the Real Python website. 

- "<i>There are many ways to test your code. In this tutorial series, youâ€™ll learn techniques from the most basic steps and work towards more advanced methods.</i>" ~ Anthony Shaw

## Test Your Code part I
Make sure to follow along with the code examples. Where appropriate, I recommend creating your own variables and classes.

- [Automated vs Manual](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#automated-vs-manual-testing)  

- [Unit Tests vs. Integrated Tests](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#unit-tests-vs-integration-tests) 

- [Choosing a Test Runner](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#choosing-a-test-runner) 

## Write Your Own Test

- Make sure you have a directory for this tutorial. 
1. Open your terminal
1. Navigate to where your makeschool work is located

   ```
   cd makeschool
   ```
1. mkdir python-testing && cd python-testing
1. mkdir my_sum && cd my_sum
1. <p>touch __init__.py</p>
